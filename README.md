# HSVAP: Hyperspectral Visualization and Processing

HSVap supports the use of advanced methods of Machine Learning for analysis of hyperspectral images by combining
  * visualization of data and results
  * exploration of data and generation of training data
  * accessing Machine Learning algorithms via an intuitive interface

HSVap is an Open Source project which is implemented in Java. 

## Key Features
  ### Visual Data Exploration
