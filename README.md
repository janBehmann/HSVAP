# HSVAP
HSVap: Hyperspectral Visualization and Processing
HSVap supports the use of advanced methods of Machine Learning for analysis of hyperspectral images by combining
  visualization of data and results
  exploration of data and generation of training data
  accessing Machine Learning algorithms via an intuitive interface

HSVap is an Open Source project which is implemented in Java. A beta release will be published in January 2015.

Key Features
  Visual Data Exploration
  
  HSVap Exploration Visualization of hyperspectral images: RGB, single features and classification resultsEasy and intuitive generation of labelled training datasetsData Mining with cluster algorithms
  Classification and Active Learning
  
  HSVap Classification Linear and non-linear classification of hyperspectral data with Support Vector MachinesAutomatic parameter optimizationActive Learning for minimizing time investment for training data generationVisualization of classification results
